# Spring-Boot Camel Simple Application

This example is based on the Apache Camel with Spring Boot log example.

The quickstart uses Spring Boot to configure a little application that includes a Camel route that triggers a message every 5th second, and routes the message to a log.

In due course an extra route will be written to take a RESTful input and output a log message
